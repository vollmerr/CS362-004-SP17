Adventurer card not shuffling cards (section not ran, as commented out). Due to this it is not always drawing the correct number of cards and possibly corrupting other parts of state (cannot tell until that issue resolved). Error consistently happens every time function called. Found from test displaying error text with issue, see where issue is in code (commented out).

Council Room card adding 3 instead of 4 cards to the current player and possibly corrupting other parts of state (cannot tell until that issue resolved). Error consistently happens every time function called. Found from test displaying error text with issue, see where issue is in code (for loop has wrong number).
